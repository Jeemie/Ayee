"It's now 5:05 and you're standing at the tree waiting for %(m)s to arrive. You expected he was going to be late based on how surprised he seemed when you passed him."

"You got the feeling he was the kind of guy who wouldn't do that on purpose. Still, it couldn't hurt to tease him a little when he did show up. Speaking of which..."

f "There you are!! You're late! I'll have you know my time is very precious!"

m "Sorry! I'm sorry!"

f "I knew you weren't gonna make it in time. Didn't you hear me before?"

m "A-Ah no, I guess I must have missed it. I'm really sorry I'm late. But I'm here now, so we should...get things going, I guess?"

f "{i}Haha he can be kinda cute when he's flustered. There's no sense in staying mad at him though.{/i}"

f "Yeah, you're right. Well, we've already introduced ourselves yesterday, so let's get down to business! I'm free on Wednesdays from 6-8 and then I'm also available at 1, but I have a class at 3, so we might be pressed for time then."

m "Wednesday at 6 works for me!"

f "Alright then! I guess we could bring dinner with us. Or if you're free before that, then we can go get some together."

"You see him straighten up a little more after you say that. It's pretty funny seeing him respond to you, as if he doesn't usually talk to girls."

f "I guess that's everything we really need to cover. I guess we could have just emailed each other, but this was good anyway."

m "Do you want to go get something to eat right now?"

f "Well, I have to get back to my homework later, but sure! I haven't eaten yet."

f "{i}Wait...{/i}"

f "{i}Wait...this doesn't count as my first date, right?{/i}"

f "{i}No, of course not!{/i}"

m "Great! I t-think they might have Chinese food in the dining h-hall today."
