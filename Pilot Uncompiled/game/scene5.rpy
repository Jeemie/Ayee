f "Hi there, %(m)s. I'm glad I could scare you awake! It's pretty funny to make you jump. Did you not sleep last night?"

m "H-Hey, %(f)s! Uh, no, I didn't sleep very well for some reason...I think it has to do with the heat here."

f "You're right. You'd think in Massachusetts it would be a bit colder at the beginning of fall. It doesn't really bother me though!"

m "Yeah, you seem perfectly fine in the heat. Was it very hot where you came from?"

f "I lived in North Carolina most of my life, so it was pretty hot for most of the year. My grandparents live in Massachusetts though, so I've been up here many times, especially in the winter when it's full of snow."
