"Today is now Tuesday and you have your chemistry class again. The thought of seeing %(f)s again makes you get to class a bit earlier than you normally would."

"When you get there, you notice that she hasn't arrived yet, and there's hardly anyone else there. Since you have no idea where she was sitting the other day, finding a seat next to her would be nearly impossible."

"You decide to go back to the seat you were originally sitting in and wait for class to start. Last night you had trouble sleeping, and you're paying for it now. You feel so tired that your eyes keep closing against your will."

"???" "Somebody must have had a rough night."

"You jump in your seat, startled at the sudden voice. Looking around, there are many more people in the room now, and sitting next to you is %(f)s."

f "Hi there, %(m)s. I'm glad I could scare you awake! It's pretty funny to make you jump. Did you not sleep last night?"

m "H-Hey, %(f)s! Uh, no, I didn't sleep very well for some reason...I think it has to do with the heat here."

f "You're right. You'd think in Massachusetts it would be a bit colder at the beginning of fall. It doesn't really bother me though!"

m "Yeah, you seem perfectly fine in the heat. Was it very hot where you came from?"

f "I lived in North Carolina most of my life, so it was pretty hot for most of the year. My grandparents live in Massachusetts though, so I've been up here many times, especially in the winter when it's full of snow."

"As you're about to respond, the professor walks into the room and calls for everybody's attention. The class goes by quickly, but you feel like you would've fallen asleep if you hadn't had %(f)s sitting next to you."

"After class, you both say goodbye and remind each other about your meeting the next day. The rest of the day seems a bit brighter now than it had before your chemistry class."
