f "No way! You were a championship fencer?"

m "Well, it's not that I was that good or anything...but my sophomore year of high school, I made it to the semi-finals of this national tournament. At the time I was ranked 4th in the US for my age."

f "{i}I wouldn't have taken him to be a fencer! He looks more like a tennis guy if you ask me.{/i}"

f "That's so incredible! You must have been awesome at it. So does that mean you're gonna join the fencing team here?"

m "Well, no, I didn't plan to..."

f "Why not? It sounds like you'd do really well in it."

m "I guess, but I haven't actually fenced since I was 15."

f "But you said you had made it to the national championship. Why stop after that?"

m "After the championship, I quit fencing to focus on getting into college. My parents had supported me completely while I was fencing, but I knew that they were having trouble keeping up with everything."

m "With work, and taking me to fencing classes, and then to another state for the championships, I didn't want to burden them anymore."

f "Wow, that's really nice of you! But now that your parents don't have to worry about you, you could always start up again, right?"

m "I-I never thought of that. You're right, I could."

m "But – I don't know – it's been a long time since I've fenced."

f "Oh, I'm sure it's just like riding a bicycle! You'd definitely get back into it!"

f "{i}I'm not actually so sure that's how it works, but encouraging him couldn't hurt.{/i}"

m "So what about you? I told you what I like to do, so what interests you?"

f "Well, I'm actually really big into art. When I was younger, I always loved art classes and drawing and painting."

f "What I really love, though, is creating things – taking empty space and filling it with something grand and beautiful! I {b}love{/b} sculpting and designing – making something that I can love and that others can see!"

f "So that's why I came here – to become a civil engineer. One day, I'm gonna build something big and beautiful in a city or a town, or even something just for me."

m "That sounds incredible. I've never thought that way about making things: so everyone can see it, but you can call it yours. Actually, that sounds kind of scary. What if nobody likes it?"

f "Well then, that's their problem! Besides, what makes you so sure everybody's going to hate what I make?!"

m "A-Ah, n-no! I didn't mean it like that! I think w-whatever you'd make would be incredible!"

"You could see that his face was turning red and that he was getting completely flustered."

f "Hahahaha! I'm just kidding, %(m)s. I knew what you meant! It is fun to tease you though. You turned pretty red there too!"

f "{i}It's fun talking with %(m)s. I don't want to seem too mean though. I'm not sure he could handle it.{/i}"

"A bit later, you both check the time and find that you've been in the dining hall talking for 2 hours. You both get up in a hurry and exchange phone numbers before heading out. You fall asleep tonight thinking of how different people are in college than in high school – and it's a good different."
